\section*{Problem 1}

\begin{proof}

Let $V = \text{span}\{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$, where $v_1, \dots, v_n$ are linearly independent elements in $V$. Then there exists $n$ linearly independent elements $x_1, \dots, x_n \in X$ such that $T(x_i) = v_i, i = 1, \dots, n$. The existence promised by the fact that $T$ is a linear operator. Let $Y_0 = \text{span}\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$. Hence, $\dim(Y_0) = \dim(V) = n$.

Also, $\ker(T) \cap Y_0 = \{0\}$. Indeed, if $\exists y\neq 0, y\in Y_0$ such that $T(y)=0$. Let $y = \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i x_i$. Then there exists $\beta_i \neq 0$. By linearity of $T$, $T(y) = \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i T(x_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i v_i \neq 0$ and it yields a contradiction.

Next, we will show $\ker(T) + Y_0 = X$. Suppose not, for any $x\in X$, there exists $z \notin \ker(T) + Y_0, w\in \ker(T), r\in Y_0$ such that $x = z + w + r$. Let $r = \sum_{i=1}^n t_i x_i$, and $T(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha v_i$.  Hence, 

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i = T(x) = T(z) + T(w) + T(r) = T(z) + \sum_{i=1}^n t_i v_i.
$$, which implies that $T(z) = \sum_{i=1}^n (\alpha_i - t_i) v_i$.

However, $z\notin \ker(T) + Y_0$ and so $T(z)\notin \text{span}\{ v_1, \dots, v_n \}\subset (\ker(T) + Y_0)$. Hence, it is a contradiction.

In conclusion, $\ker(T)+Y_0 = X$ and $\ker(T)\cap Y_0 = \{0\}$, and it implies that $X = \ker(T) \oplus Y_0$.

\end{proof}


\section*{Problem 2}

\begin{proof}

If $T$ is continuous, then the preimage(i.e., $\ker(T)$) of $\{0\}$ is closed since $\{0\}$ is closed. Also, $\ker(T)$ is a subspace due to the linearity of $T$.

If $\ker(T)$ is a closed subspace in $X$, we need to show that $T$ is continuous, or equivalently, bounded. Since $Y$ is a finite-dimensional space, from the result of problem 1, we know there exists a finite-dimensional subspace $Y_0\subset X$ such that $X = \ker(T)\oplus Y_0 $. Hence, for any $x\in X$, there exists $y\in \ker(T), z\in Y_0$ such that $x = y + z$.

Consider the norm of $T$, 

$$
\|T\|_\infty = \sup_{\|x\|\leqslant  1}\|T(x)\| \leqslant\sup_{\|x\|\leqslant  1 \\ y\in \ker} .
$$

\section*{Problem 3}

\begin{proof}

Denote the graph of $f$ as $G(f):= \{ (x, f(x)) | x\in X \} \subset X\times Y$. Let $\{z_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N} = \{ (x_n, f(x_n)) \}_{n\in\mathbb N} \subset G(f)$ that converges to $z = (x, y)$. It is enough to show that $y = f(x)$.

Indeed, $x = \lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty} x_n$ and so $\lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty} f(x_n) = f(x)$ due to the continuity of $f$. Also, $y = \lim_{n\rightarrow +\infty} f(x_n)$. Hence, $y = f(x)$.

\end{proof}

{\color{red}Question:} Here we only need $X, Y$ to be metric spaces. We didn't really need completeness. Is it correct?


\section*{Problem 4}

\begin{enumerate}

\item [(a)]

\begin{proof}
Prove by contradiction.

Suppose that $f$ is not continuous on $\mathbb R$. Hence, there exists one sequence $\{x_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}\subset \mathbb R$ that converges to $x$, such that a subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}_{k\geqslant 1} \subset \{x_n\}_{n\geqslant 1}$, from which $\{f(x_{n_k})\}$ doesn't converge to $f(x)$. 

Since $f$ is bounded, we know that $\{f(x_{n_k})\}$ must have a convergent subsequence, denote as $\{f(x_{n_{k_l}})\}_{l\geqslant 1} \rightarrow y$. Also, we know $\{x_{n_{k_l}}\} \rightarrow x$ and with closeness of $G(f)$, we know $y = f(x)$. This is equivalent to say that  $\{f(x_{n_{k_l}})\}_{l\geqslant 1} \rightarrow f(x)$. It leads to a contradiction to the assumption that $\{f(x_{n_k})\}$ doesn't converge to $f(x)$.

In conclusion, $f$ is a continuous function.

\end{proof}

\item [(b)]

Let $f$ be the following function,

$$
f(x) = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{x}\qquad x \neq 0\\
0 \qquad x = 0.
\end{aligned}
\right.
$$
