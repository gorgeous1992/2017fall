\section*{Recent Plans}

I registered three classes for 2017 Fall semester. They are
\begin{itemize}
\item
MA 515 Functional Analysis    \quad   (Dr. Tien-Khai Nguyen)
\item
MA 591 Semi-Definite Programming \quad (Dr. David Papp)
\item
MA 790 Convex Analysis \quad  (Dr. Patrick Louis Combettes)
\end{itemize}

To explore more topics and also get a review of the knowledge I learned before, I plan to read  the book.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Convex Optimization (Author: Stephen Boyd, Lieven Vandenberghe)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Comments}


Today is my first day to get into this research group and this is a very short report for this week. I am not very familiar with writing the weekly report so please let me know if you have any suggestions or advice on the format, the content or any other thing. Any help will be appreciated.

I appreciate it that I can be financially supported by Dr. Medhin and co-advised by Dr. Fang. I will try my best and be hardworking.
